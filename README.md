[![Build Status](https://app.travis-ci.com/vherzog/ssw567-hw2.svg?branch=main)](https://app.travis-ci.com/vherzog/ssw567-hw2)  [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/vherzog/ssw567-hw2/branch/hw5-static-analysis/graph/badge.svg?token=IE4K1ZFMIF)](https://codecov.io/gh/vherzog/ssw567-hw2)

## HW 05 Deliverables
1. The GitHub URL containing the code that was analyzed: **https://github.com/vherzog/ssw567-hw2**
2. The name and output of the static code analyzer tool you used: **`pylint`**
3. The name and output of the code coverage tool you used;
4. Identify both your original test cases and new test cases that you created to achieve at least 80% code coverage.
5. Attach screen shots of the output of the static code analyzer as well as code coverage.  You should show a screen shot of the analysis results both before and after any changes that you make to your programs:
  * Static code analysis report on original program
  * Code coverage report before any changes to the program
  * Static code analysis report after you have made changes to eliminate issues
  * Code coverage after any changes to the programs (coverage should be > 80%)
